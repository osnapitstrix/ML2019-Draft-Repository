        "## SECTION 1. Project Definition and Project Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "The project involves developing an information system to improve the operations of a major travel company's Call Management Centre (CMC). At current state there, the lack of an information system means that a lot of the functions are conducted manually and at an ad-hoc pace affecting the call flow rate. \n",
        "\n",
        "This proposal will uncover how an improved call routing and dynamic call flow system can better be used to achieve CMC's business goals by streamlining business processes to increase overall efficiency. The report will examine the five phases of design thinking principles to develop and test the system, the illustration of agile methodology and the assumptions required to develop the system prototype. Furthermore, a critical evaluation will be completed to provide a comparison highlighting competitive advantages that will accompany the implementation of the new information system. \n",
        "\n",
        "The main project objective is to create an information system that meets the following criteria: \n",
        "* improves the operations of the in-house call management centre\n",
        "* has the capability to adjust the call flow rate to suitable relationship managers (RM)\n",
        "* improves call routing and dynamic flow for both inbound and outbound calls\n",
        "* directs customers to appropriate Relationship Managers (RM) by matching customers to a relationship manager based on performance, product knowledge and customer profiles\n",
        "* reduces customer's waiting time with the Automatic Call Distributor routing the call to a relationship manager that best matches and has the appropriate skill levels.\n",
        "* targets potential buyers with outbound calls through automatically dialling numbers according to a customer target list generated by the system. This will allow the travel company to gain potential customers.\n",
        "* has repeat customers that are satisfied with their experience with the CMC system\n",
        "\n",
        "## SECTION 2: Stakeholders\n",
        "There are three main stakeholders that have been identified. \n",
        "1. Customer: We have identified customers as a stakeholder as they are one of the most important stakeholders of any business, without them the business does not run as our main purpose is to serve our clients to the best of our ability. They become stakeholders of the company as they are interested in the service we provide and are directly impacted by the quality and value of our service. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. Relationship Manager: We have identified a Relationship Manager (RM) as a stakeholder as they are one of the main employees within this company. They are the ones directly providing the service to the customers through communication. They have a direct stake within the company as their interest lies in providing the best service to the customers, and through earning an income to support themselves through the company, therefore they have an effect on the effort put into the service as well as being affected by the company. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. Travel Company Owner: We have identified the Travel Company Owner as a stakeholder as they are the most critical stakeholder as they control the business. They are in charge of and control all the management, finances and strategy in regards to the company, making them liable for the impacts of the company. Their interest as stakeholders lies in the significant decisions they make within the company regarding both internal and external stakeholders, making their role as owner and stakeholder one of extreme importance. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## SECTION 3: Approach from a Design Thinking Perspective\n",
        "\n",
        "Each phase of design thinking will be analysed carefully to provide a better understanding of how the individual phases assist in reducing and resolving issues related to developing the CMC information system.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### STEP 1.Empathise \n",
        "Allows for the understanding of the user's pain points and potential improvements that will be required to be developed to enhance the user experience. A method for approaching this phase involves the need for interacting with users and considering their viewpoint on the issue. From the interviews conducted, an empathy map was created to provide visualisation of the user's, i.e. customers as well as other stakeholders attitude and behaviours. This will assist the UX team in revealing any in the current user data and support the greater understanding of end-users. \n",
        "\n",
        "### STEP 2.Define \n",
        "From the data gathered, it will allow for better exploration and understanding of the core problems identified by users. The overall problem definition consists of – \"A major travel company would like to develop an information system to improve the operation\n",
        "of their in-house call management centre (CMC)\". With these details, the system designers/developers can envision the functions, features and other elements of the system, which will assist in solving the defined problem. \n",
        "\n",
        "### STEP 3. Ideate\n",
        "This stage is the most fundamental to the creative development associated with design thinking. By the utilisation of ideation techniques, i.e. asking \"How Might We...\" questions, allows for the expansion and further breakdown of the problem space and stimulates free thinking. Furthermore, the added understanding of a potential customer or other stakeholders pains and gains, the project team are able to look for alternative ways to view the problem. Additionally, the empathy maps developed in stage 1 illustrate the interviewees' pains and gains on the potential change. \n",
        "\n",
        "The interviewees' perspectives from the empathy map can be used as a guideline for developing \"how might we\" (\"HMW\") statements to kick start brainstorming or further ideation sessions for the project team. \n",

        "### STEP 4. Prototype\n",
        "The prototyping stage will involve the system developers producing inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the proposed application, capturing all required features. This will be done in an iterative process by continuous check-ins with the Travel Company owner and other stakeholders to ensure the system is meeting their needs. The prototype will be tested/used by the staff of CMC to identify whether the system achieves the best possible solution for the issues acknowledged in the previous stages of this process. The system solutions which will increase efficiency by streamlining the interactions process will be highlighted within the prototype. \n",

        "### Reflections Based on Design Thinking Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the empathy maps we have as a team been able to evaluate the customer and their relationship with the RM, which allowed us to attain different perceptions of the customer and the RM. It allowed us to understand how the customer may feel and their needs and wants regarding this experience. We concluded that the customer going into this experience does not have any knowledge and is merely a curious client wanting to be given all the knowledge possible in regards to travel packages. The customer will continue to extract more information to increase their understanding and knowledge about the travel packages and what will work best for them. We have also identified the three key stakeholders within this company as being the Relationship Manager (RM), the customer and the Manager of the RM's/Company as we believe these are the main roles involved and that hold sufficient interest within the company. In regards to the prototype, we as a team will decide which possible prototype design we feel will succeed and provide us as the most breakthrough solution. Through some further brainstorming, we concluded that some solutions we could implement are collaborating with other airlines and developing sale and inventory system application.\n",

        "## SECTION 4. Agile Methodology: Scrum\n",
        "Agile models refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development. The agile methodology that will be useful for the travel company is Scrum. ‘Scrum is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering the business value in the shortest time.’ (Chandran 2020).  Scrum also involves a self-organising team of product owner, scrum master and development team roles. This team must adapt to changing business and technology needs and ‘accomplish the work without depending on others’. (Chandran 2020)\n",

        "\n",
        "For the Inbound Collaborative Diagram, there are two things that might happen when a customer calls the CMC system: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. If the CMC is busy, the customer will be redirected to the Interactive Voice Response. This Interactive Voice Response will ask the customer reasons why they are calling the CMC. The customer will respond to the question. Based on the response, the Interactive Voice Response will redirect the customer to the automatic call distributor. When the customer is at this stage, they wait until there is an available Relationship Manager to attend to their needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. If the CMC is not busy, the customer and relationship manager profiles are retrieved from their profiler tools. They are matched based on the segmentation technique. After, the system requests for customer likelihood purchase score and relationship manager skill score which is calculated as they are matched. The customer with very high likelihood purchase scores are redirected to the next available Relationship Manager. The Relationship Manager will attend to their needs and try to sell the travel packages.\n",

        "## SECTION 7: Competitive Advantages and Adverse Effects to Business if Project Fails\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        " 1. Successfully differentiating service\n",
        " \n",
        "One of many competitive advantages the new information system can bring to the company is greater market share, by providing differentiated services. Reducing wait times for customers contacting a Relationship Manager (RM) and increasing the accuracy of RMs correctly matching to customers, current and potential consumers would deviate towards this company, instead of others. By capitalising on the unique feature of relationship marketing via phone, this company can reach successful milestones in the future such as company expansions and greater profits. \n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Reduce costs and achieve economies of scale\n",
        " \n",
        "The new information system will also encourage the company to achieve economies of scales in the long run, by serving the maximum number of customers, with the lowest production costs. Pain points, such as long wait times between RM and customer allocations, and the outbound call process of RMs contacting customers, is leading to loss of productivity and profits. Improving the efficiency of the system by reducing wait times to a maximum of two minutes, will ensure customers have minimal interaction with the Interactive Voice Response Unit, which research has proven, ‘frustrates’ customers (Bitner, M.J., 2011, p.10), whilst maintaining productivity and sales. The efficient system will also reduce costs associated with electricity and specialised software and programs, as RMs will be aware of frequent travellers, who are responsive to outbound calls. \n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Increased shareholders profits for R&D\n",
        " \n",
        "Another advantage the new system would bring to the company is greater shareholder interest and funding. A successful system would be able to generate increased profits for the company, resulting in support from shareholders, who will receive a greater dividend in return. Recognition from shareholders is vital for the company if it wants research and development to improve the current new system in the future. By consistently updating the system, the company ensures they remain at the top the industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        " 1. If the new project fails in its differentiation, there is an increased risk of losing both potentials and repeat clients. The standout feature in this company is their call management centre (CMC), which can allocate RMs to customers, based on their travel needs and purchase history. If the vital component of the new system fails, it would cause frustration amongst customers and decrease an RMs selling streak. Eventually, the longevity of the company will be compromised.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Lack of economies of scale can reduce current and future potential\n",
        "The failure of a new system can have a detrimental impact on the company’s cost structures and overall profits. The level of productivity the company can achieve, will not be unlocked, leading to the loss of labour and customers, as both groups divert to the competition. Attaining economies of scale is essential; otherwise, the company will struggle to reach cover costs and maintain adequate profits.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Decreased shareholder trust for future projects\n",
        "If the new system cannot function, there will be reduced shareholder interest and diminished certainty for the company, to regain the lost interest. Shareholders would be hesitant to reinvest in the company due to fear of loss, significantly impacting the company’s available funds. In the long term, this can negatively impact funding for research and development.\n",
